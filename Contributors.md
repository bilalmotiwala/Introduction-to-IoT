### Why So Late?
Well I wasn't really into NFTs until about a few weeks ago.

### What is this project?
This project is probably the highlight of my university life and hence I have decided to make it into an NFT and add all the contributors into this file from the original team behind the submission. Thanks guys for making that happen.

### The Team

### What's Next?
Well nothing much really. Hope that we all make it and see you guys somewhere, sometime at someplace in the future, all happy, successful and living lives to fullest potential.
